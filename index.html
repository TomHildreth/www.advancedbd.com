The monthly utility cost of his new SIP home on Daniel Island S.C is $124, which is 67% less. He also told us "his air-conditioner rarely comes on and he was not sure he needed it".

For a project to maximize its energy efficiency and utility savings, the entire building envelope has to be constructed with the most thermally resistant and cost-effective building material.
